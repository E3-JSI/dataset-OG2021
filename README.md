# WorldNews Data Set

This repository contains the source code for creating the WorldNews Data Set,
the data set containing news articles. The articles are in different languages
and cover various topics.

The goal of this project is to create a multilingual news article corpus used
for news stream clustering and topic classification.

## News Stream Clustering

The original idea of this data set is to provide a gold standard data set for
benchmarking news stream clustering algorithms. To each article an event ID is
assigned; articles with the same event ID are describing the same event.
