### Naming Conventions

Since notebooks ar challenging object for source control, we will not
collaborate directly with others on Jupyter notebooks. There are two
steps we will use to collaborate effectively:

1. Follow a naming convention that shows the owner and the order the analysis
   was done. We will use the format `<step>-<ghuser>-<description>.ipynb`.
   Example: `01-eriknovak-raw-data-analysis.ipynb`.

2. Refactor the good parts. To avoid code duplication (i.e. having the same
   code in multiple parts), we will put the code in the appropriate `/src`
   folder.
