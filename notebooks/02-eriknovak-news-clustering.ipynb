       " 'body': \"The Bruins exceeded expectations and came tantalizingly close to capturing a second title for the city, rolling all the way to the Stanley Cup Final before succumbing to the St. Louis Blues in seven games. Meanwhile, the Red Sox and Celtics underachieved, submitting disappointing performances in seasons in which both were expected to compete for a title.\\n\\nThere were notable figures who left town, whether it was a franchise tight end choosing to call it a career or a pair of All-Stars departing via free agency to compete for division rivals.\\n\\nAn unexpected run culminated in the state's flagship university skating all the way to the NCAA hockey championship game and boasting the top player in the country.\\n\\nAnd among the notable deaths in the sports world were a pair of beloved figures from the world of baseball whose all-too-soon passings bookended the year.\\n\\nHere's a look back at the year in sports.\\n\\n■ Appearing in their third Winter Classic, and first as the visiting team, the Bruins defeat the Chicago Blackhawks, 4-2, in front of 76,126 fans at Notre Dame Stadium.\\n\\n■ The Patriots advance to their 11th Super Bowl in franchise history by defeating a pair of AFC West foes in the playoffs.

Video of a conversation between him and Kevin Durant gives rise to speculation that the two free agents-to-be will look to play on the same team the following season.\\n\\n■ The Bruins pull off a pair of trades ahead of the NHL deadline, sending Ryan Donato to the Wild for Charlie Coyle, and prying Marcus Johansson from the Devils for a pair of draft picks.\\n\\n■ Tributes pour in from all over the baseball world after veteran Globe reporter Nick Cafardo collapses while covering the Red Sox at spring training and dies unexpectedly.\\n\\n■ NFL free agency gets underway, and the Patriots take a hit when defensive lineman Trey Flowers signs with the Lions and offensive tackle Trent Brown signs with the Raiders.\\n\\n■ Tight end Rob Gronkowski ends months of speculation and announces his retirement from football after nine seasons and three Super Bowl championships with the Patriots.\\n\\n■ BC High repeats as Super 8 champion by defeating Pope Francis, 2-1, in the longest hockey playoff game in MIAA history at 87 minutes and 22 seconds.\\n\\n■ Greg Schiano, thought to be the Patriots' next defensive coordinator, resigns from his position with the team.\\n\\n■ The UMass hockey team reaches the Frozen Four for the first time in program history, advancing to the championship game with an overtime win against Denver before losing to Minnesota-Duluth.\\n\\n■ Two days after winning the Hobey Baker Award, and one day after playing in the NCAA championship game, UMass defenseman Cale Makar signs with the Colorado Avalanche, then scores a goal on his first shot in the NHL in a playoff game.\\n\\n■ Lawrence Cherono outkicks former champion Lelisa Desisa to win the men's title in the Boston Marathon by two seconds in 2:07:57.

He had suffered from Parkinson's disease.\\n\\n■ The Patriots make 10 selections in the NFL Draft, beginning with wide receiver N'Keal Harry with the last pick of the first round.\\n\\n■ After sweeping the Pacers in the first round, the Celtics are bounced from the playoffs by the Bucks, losing in the Eastern Conference semifinals, four games to one.\\n\\n■ The Bruins sweep the Hurricanes to advance to their first Stanley Cup Final since 2013.\\n\\n■ The Red Sox place second baseman Dustin Pedroia on the 60-day disabled list with more knee woes, leaving his future uncertain.\\n\\n■ The Red Sox select Noah Song, a pitcher from the Naval Academy, in the fourth round of the MLB draft.

Danny Ainge comes up with a Plan B, though, and lands Kemba Walker.\\n\\n■ Seemingly as an afterthought, the Celtics sign 7-foot-5-inch rookie free agent center Tacko Fall to a contract after he was undrafted coming out of Central Florida. He impresses in the summer league, and earns a two-way contract.\\n\\n■ The United States defeats the Netherlands, 2-0, to win the Women's World Cup. Hanson's Sam Mewis, who played midfield, enjoys a hero's welcome upon returning to Massachusetts.\\n\\n■ Despite numerous holes to plug, particularly in the bullpen, the Red Sox stand pat at the trade deadline, setting the stage for a disappointing final two months of the season.\\n\\n■ Tom Brady agrees to a two-year extension with the Patriots, but the two years are voidable, meaning he could become a free agent in March 2020.\\n\\n■ Chris Sale is shut down by the Red Sox after getting an injection of platelet-rich plasma for his ailing left elbow, allowing him to avoid Tommy John surgery. He is shut down with a 6-11 record and 4.40 ERA for the season.\\n\\n■ Red Sox pitcher David Price is placed on the injured with a sore wrist.

Eduardo Rodriguez comes up one short in his bid to reach 20 wins.\\n\\n■ Entering the final year of his rookie deal, Jaylen Brown agrees to a four-year contract extension with the Celtics.\\n\\n■ Two Massachusetts high school soccer players are suspended from all high school sports for a year by the MIAA for shoving an official after a boys' tournament game.
